## Using MLflow for Experiment Tracking and Model Management
### Given Tasks are :
- Integrate MLflow into your existing machine learning projects.
- Train machine learning models while logging relevant information with MLflow.
- Demonstrate how to log parameters, metrics, and artifacts using MLflow tracking APIs.
- Customizing MLflow UI with run names.
- Demonstrate metric plots.
- Demonstrate hyperparameter plots.
- Demonstrate how to register models and manage by tagging them.
- `(BONUS)` Build a Prefect Workflow and Auto Schedule it. Show the Prefect Dashboard with relevant outputs.
