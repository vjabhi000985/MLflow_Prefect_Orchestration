## Using MLflow for Experiment Tracking and Model Management
### Given Tasks are :
- Integrate MLflow into your existing machine learning projects.
- Train machine learning models while logging relevant information with MLflow.
- Demonstrate how to log parameters, metrics, and artifacts using MLflow tracking APIs.
- Customizing MLflow UI with run names.
- Demonstrate metric plots.
- Demonstrate hyperparameter plots.
- Demonstrate how to register models and manage by tagging them.
- `(BONUS)` Build a Prefect Workflow and Auto Schedule it. Show the Prefect Dashboard with relevant outputs.

### Tools Used:
- `MLflow` : Open-source platform for managing the Machine Learning (ML) lifecycle.
   - *Streamlines deployment*: Simplifies the process of deploying models to production.
   - *Automates workflows*: Integrates with tools for experiment scheduling and deployment pipelines.

- `Prefect` : Manages task dependencies and execution order with scheduling options.
- `DagsHub` : Collaborative platform for data science and ML projects.

#### Relationship among the used tools:
